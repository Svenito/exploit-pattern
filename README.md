# Python Exploit Pattern Tool

Python implementation of Metasploit's pattern generator and search. Should be python 
version agnostic, tested and working with Python 2.7.12 up to and including Python 3.11.1

Starts faster and rolls both tools into one.

No extra dependencies required, works with vanilla python

## Also available

I've made a Go version of this tool available here

git clone git://git.unlogic.co.uk/exploit-pattern

It comes with a few caveats like increased filesize of binary vs execution time, but works in the same way.

## Generate a pattern

    $> pattern.py 100
    Aa0Aa0Aa1Aa1Aa2Aa2Aa3Aa3Aa4Aa4Aa5Aa5Aa6Aa6Aa7Aa7Aa8Aa8Aa9Aa9Ab0Ab0Ab1Ab1Ab2Ab2Ab3Ab3Ab4Ab4Ab5Ab5Ab6A

## Search for a pattern

    $> pattern.py Bf4B
    Pattern Bf4 first occurrence at position 942 in pattern.
    $> pattern.py 0x42346642
    Pattern 0x42346642 first occurrence at position 942 in pattern.

## Optional automatically copy to clipboard

(Thanks to abeljm for this feature)

If your Python installation has the [clipboard](https://pypi.org/project/clipboard/)
package installed, the generated DeBruijin pattern is automatically copied to the system
clipboard when it is generated as well as printed to stdout. If the package is missing,
the copy to clipboard feature is skipped.

NOTE: On KDE 5 there is an issue with klipper and the clipboard package. You may need to manually
run `klipper` in a terminal before running `pattern.py`

## Use it in your own python code

After placing pattern.py in the same directory as your script:

```python
from pattern import pattern_gen

print(pattern_gen(10))
```

or

```python
from pattern import pattern_search

found_at = pattern_search('Bf4B')
```

## Obtaining

Clone the repo, or if you are on a machine without git you can use

    $> curl https://is.gd/xpattern -o pattern.py

or

    $> wget https://is.gd/xpattern -o pattern.py

Or change the `pattern.py` to whatever filename you like
